Description
-----------

Using microservices is a popular way to develop applications in a polyglot manner. This creates additional challenges. You have to manage several runtimes and require a language-agnostic protocol to achieve integration between services. Is there a better alternative? GraalVM is a game-changer technology that provides direct interoperability between programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and R. This session describes the quest to simplify microservices development by leveraging GraalVM as a shared runtime. The presentation uses Eclipse MicroProfile to provide a standard specification for developing, securing, documenting, probing, and tracing microservices.
