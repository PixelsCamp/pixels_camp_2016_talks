What does Big Brother have to do with identity? Let's find out.

When the Internet appeared, it was used mainly for military and academic purposes. All computers were linked to their local networks. They were trusted, as everyone knew who were they. As the number of systems on the Internet grew, and as the networks became connected, that trust died, and mechanisms were added to such systems to identify who is contacting whom: authentication. 

Unfortunately, the problem has never really been solved. 

According to the Hyperledger Indy project, "the most common (and universally hated) system, that of user IDs and passwords, is full of problems. The resulting lack of certainty of who is on the other keyboard has led to the loss of billions from hacks, data breaches, identity theft, scams, and more. Further, that same lack of certainty has made many types of business transactions on the Internet impossible - the risk is just too high".

Besides exposing our data to hackers and Big Brother, authentication with usernames is company-centric: it allows companies to manage their user's identities and correlate them across different services. This intricate web of identities correlated in our most various aspects of life (our e-mail, telephone number, physical address, photos, credit card numbers, financial data, daily commutes, friends, political associations, and much more).
This information, when processed via artificial intelligence techniques, leads to an omnipresent and Big Brother.

Web 3.0 appears as the solution to this problem, leveraging technologies such as blockchain. Projects like Hyperledger Indy leverage decentralized identifiers and Verifiable Credentials to add identity as a core component of the Internet, leading to better privacy and control of our own identity.

In this talk, I'll explain what is the idea behind the Web 3.0 movement, introduce blockchain, and tackle in detail how it can solve the authentication problem. The talk has a significant focus on the self-sovereign identity concept and how both DIDs and VCs work.
