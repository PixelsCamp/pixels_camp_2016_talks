## Description

**TL;DRL:** F**k you, 2014, and your Jquerys and Bootstraps.


Magic the Gathering is one of most popular tabletop games in the world. And just like as with any other man-made endeavour, it is a mess.

Calm down, I'm not insulting your favorite game just yet!

My pet project for the past few months has been to build a mobile-friendly & user-friendly search engine for this.

Dealing with the highly unsystematic world of MTG cards has been quite a ride. There are several APIs that provide this data already. But they don't match each other each other on, for example, card names, and often provide only incomplete data.

And, of course, no pet project would be complete without experimenting with the new bells & whistles of the development community. We're in In 2016, those are called TypeScript, Elixir, GraphQL, and Docker.

This is not meant to be an in-depth talk about a particular development topic, but rather an overview of how coding for the web in 2017 can be a great experience, even for a developer working on alone & on a budget.

In this talk, I'll cover two main topics:

1. The MTG side:
  - How I had to juggle several data sources that didn't even agree with each other.
2. The Development side:
  - How to build a back-end with next to zero back-end logic, using Phoenix & GraphQL for declaratively defining our data sources;
  - How to take the Java (and even the Script) out of JavaScript, with Types and actually good tooling;
  - How to hakuna matata and not worry, thanks to Docker.

## Speaker Bio

I've been working on the web For the past four years, mostly writing Ruby, but also some awesome web animation on the side.
I have a passion for Open-source, and for giving back to the community. I've taught programming to hundreds of people (between meetups, university courses, 1-1 mentoring, and even our own coding school), and have helped organize several meetups and development conferences (most notably RubyConf Portugal).
When I'm not busy building high-quality web code, or bothering others with my teachings, I might still be busy trying to become a real game developer. Being an astronaut is no longer an option, so that's the one childhood dream I still have going on.
