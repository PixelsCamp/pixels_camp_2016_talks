## Description

Crystal is a typed, `LLVM` compiled language that reads (mostly) as Ruby.

If you've ever faced a problem in which you would like to use Ruby (because it
is awesome), but it is just not performant enough, maybe Crystal is the solution
you've been looking for.

Crystal's standard lib comes bundled with support for `WebSockets`, `OAuth`, `MySQL`,
and other nice utilities. It has a very simple testing framework, dependency
management system, and even the beginnings of a web framework.

This is a very exciting time to come aboard the Crystal train, especially coming
from a Ruby background.
