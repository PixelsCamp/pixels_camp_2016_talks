Description
-----------

Fueled by last year's appearance of an actual ZX Spectrum, I've managed to get my units back to working condition

In this short talk I'll explain what you need to do to your ageing hardware in order to make them work again. This is specific for the Speccy but most can be also used for C64 ans Atari ST machines.

Emulators are fun, easy and convenient but nothing like the actual feel of that crappy rubber keys


Speaker Bio
-----------

Legendary bicopter/tricopter builder, member of the fine One Over Zero community, mostly known as the "lobster crew"
Co-creator of OOZLabs, a closed maker group that essentially makes things and stuff.
