Description
-----------

Browsers are complex beasts.

In this talk we are going to take a look at the browsers Layout engine (mostly blink and a bit of gecko) and their JavaScript engine (mostly V8)

We will start by looking at the Browser Architecture and proceed into its threads:

- The IO Thread
- The main thread
- The render thread
- other threads

Then we will take a look at the common architecture of a JS engine and how your code can benefit from it.

Hopefully after this talk you will be able to produce code that does not step into the browser toes.

Since the early web days that I have been a curious web developer. Sometimes that curiosity has taken me through the path of apparently useless things. Like the browsers engines.
