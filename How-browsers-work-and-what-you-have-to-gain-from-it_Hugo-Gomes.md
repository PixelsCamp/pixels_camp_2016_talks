Description
-----------

Browsers are complex beasts.

In this talk I will walk through their theoretical architecture and how things work bellow the DOM.

I will introduce some common quircks and how to solve them with careful planning that is appropriate to the browsers pulse and design.

Hopefully after this talk you will be able to produce code that does not step into the browser toes.

Since the early web days that I have been a curious web developer. Sometimes that curiosity has taken me through the path of apparently useless things. Like the browsers engines.
