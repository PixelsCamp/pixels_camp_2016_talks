* Length    : 30 minutes
* Language  : English

Description
-----------

For several years now, that weâ€™ve been trying to find new solutions on how we could develop a single project and run it on all platforms. Weâ€™ve been seeing all types of solutions: some are web-based, others require you to learn a new language, and others even may require that you pay a monthly fee to use. It also comes with the drawback that all your UI depends on the framework implementation. So, if thereâ€™s a native update youâ€™ll need to wait until someone rewrites the widgets for you to update your app.

Kotlin multiplatform gives us a new solution. It focuses on sharing your business logic across all platforms, leaving the UI to be implemented natively. Since itâ€™s Kotlin, you can take full advantage of its language features - concise, safe, etc. Moreover, if youâ€™re coming from android you might already be familiarised with Kotlin and even if youâ€™re an iOS developer youâ€™ll see that itâ€™s quite similar to Swift.

Join me on this triathlon and letâ€™s go through Android, iOS, and Web in under 30 minutes.
