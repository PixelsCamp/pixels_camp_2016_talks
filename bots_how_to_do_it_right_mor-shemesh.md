Description
-----------

Microsoft Bot Framework has made a big change in the world of bots,
enabling developers to forget about complicated frameworks and APIs and offering in their stead a common framework that solidifies all
other major frameworks under the same umbrella.

Bots, is a new type of application, with it's positive and negative aspects, 
which can be integrated in many ways into different types of applications and in different ways,
as well as leveraging various technologies (natural language understanding for example).

In this talk I'll cover *Microsoft Bot Framework* (MBF) and why building a bot is easy (using Node.js) using this new framework. 
I'll also be building a new bot from scratch, describing the process on the way and talk about the different 
bot type we can building using MBF.

To conclude I'll talk about the different appraoches companies I've worked with has taken when developing bots - 
What is good, what is bad, and what is, sometimes... is ugly.
