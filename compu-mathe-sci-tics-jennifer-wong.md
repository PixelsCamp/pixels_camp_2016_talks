Description
-----------

Math. Computer science. Computers were invented to do complicated mathematics. But JavaScript wasn’t. It was created to assemble components and be written directly in web page markup. So how does Math fit into all of this? Well, JavaScript has had a Math object since its inception in 1997. 

Sooo, exactly how much math can we do with JavaScript? Let’s do some exploration together. From sine to log to hypotenuse, we’ll wind our way through the Math object in JavaScript and see just how closely we can mimic a graphing calculator. Let’s travel back in time and use computer science to do math again!

I’ll discuss the history of math, computer science, and JavaScript. Then we’ll hop forward in time and do tons of wacky mathematics using JavaScript’s impressively extensive Math object. Come with me, and you’ll see, a world of pure mathemagination… in JavaScript.
