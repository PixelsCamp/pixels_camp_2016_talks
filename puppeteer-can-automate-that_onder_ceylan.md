Description
-----------

Puppeteer is a node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome over the DevTools Protocol. It is mostly used and considered for scraping content, UI testing and automated form submissions. This talk aims to change this mindset by inspiring you on observing your daily routines and common patterns on your development and testing workflows. It will help you automate them in a creative way!

We’ll explore capabilities of Puppeteer with combination of DevTools protocol and cloud functions (FaaS) across a showcase of real life use cases demonstrated over 21 demos on stage. Finally, we’ll go through existing Puppeteer based SaaS solutions to inspire everyone in the room to build next SaaS solution or open source project with Puppeteer.

### Technologies

My talk will touch on the grounds of web standards, graphics / css filters, performance and server side JS, cloud functions (FaaS) topics. 

Following tags summarizes the tech referenced in the talk:
**chromium** **devtools** **chrome-devtools-protocol** **javascript** **nodejs** **puppeteer** **css** **test-tooling** **jest** **performance**

### Purpose of the talk

Puppeteer is most of the times used and considered by developers for scraping content or automated form submission. This is what people think about when the idea of browser automation is pitched. My goal is to change this mindset and to inspire people for the things that can be automated with a powerful browser & tooling pair. Especially, when Chrome DevTools Protocol and protocol monitor on Chrome is introduced to the audience, there's no limit on the automation possibilities.

### Target audience

Any software or QA engineer who uses Chrome / DevTools.

### Audience takeaway

I expect people to be inspired and excited by the capabilities of Puppeteer and the automation possibilities out there when I demonstrate 21 examples on stage. One of the demos can be seen here: [https://twitter.com/onderceylan/status/1197083395769208832](https://twitter.com/onderceylan/status/1197083395769208832)

I believe this talk will inspire everyone in the room to build next SaaS solution or open source project with Puppeteer to automate their daily routines and common problems.

### Remarks from the community

It got great feedback so far. I heard so many good things about it on offline and online channels. Some online feedbacks are like;

### Why me talking abut Puppeteer?

I've spent fair amount of time on the subject on my journey of developing and maintaining my recent open source project: [pwa-asset-generator](https://github.com/onderceylan/pwa-asset-generator). I presented this topic in front of various communities like Frontmania, AmsterdamJS, perf.now(), C'T and more to come.
