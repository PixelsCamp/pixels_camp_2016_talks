The Makey Claw is a hacking project The altLab collective, created it for the community to experience the i2c or serial communication protocols using microcontrollers.
The aim is to trim creativity and bring the makers to rethink the interaction interface with the real world through the use of micro-controllers.
The machine brains is our building block developed by Master JA, best known for CSEduino.

Go to our [github][1] page unload the code, connect your controller  and bring your driver to try your luck and catch a gift.

AltLab is a col­lec­tive dedi­ca­ted to inde­pen­dent rese­arch and expe­ri­men­ta­tion in alter­na­tive media. Com­mu­nity-based and com­mu­nity-buil­ding by nature, it seeks to pro­mote active par­ti­ci­pa­tion, kno­wledge sha­ring, and col­la­bo­ra­tion among indi­vi­du­als such as artists, pro­gram­mers, engi­ne­ers,  hobbyists, sci­en­tists, and all those who wish to fre­ely explore cre­a­tive and eman­ci­pa­tory uses of tech­no­logy. Just like many other hac­kers­pa­ces which have emer­ged all over the world in recent years, AltLab has also been foun­ded on the noti­ons of software/hardware libre and the belief in col­lec­tive inde­pen­dent plat­forms for open and active kno­wledge-sha­ring and expe­ri­men­ta­tion...
