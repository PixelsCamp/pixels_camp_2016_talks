Description
-----------

This talk is a brief introduction to the modern network stack protocols from the standpoint of a front-end developer. We will be taking a dive into the following protocols:

	- Layer 2: NDP
	- Layer 3: IPv6
	- Layer 4: QUIC

I will do a top->down approach and start by introducing the main enemy of us all: latency; and then proceed with a quick look into how HTTP/2 works and goes down the stack.
