On the sixth of July, 2016, John Hanke, CEO of Niantic, looked down upon the world and said, "let there be Pokemon".

Since then, trainers worldwide, of all shapes and sizes, ventured upon the ultimate Pokemon playground, the world, and started their journey filled with stuck pokeballs, wonky login servers, general instability and yes, Pokemon. However, some trainers realized their dev skills could be put to good use, and multiple tools like [maps](https://pokevision.com/), [overlays](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hqt.apps.poke&hl=en) and [services](https://pogotoolkit.com/) were released to the world, beginning a long cat-and-mouse affair began between Niantic and these developers.

But, behind all the magic, how does it really work behind the scenes? How are people predicting what pokemon spawn and where? Is there a public API I can use? Are all Pokemon the same? Why were the servers on fire before the public release? How do Pokemon spawns even work? What is the 3-step bug? And what's Ingress got to do with all this? 

In this talk, we'll go over all those facts and more, by presenting the technical details behind the game and their evolution, revealed through the community's open reverse engineering efforts and framed in the development of [my own pokemon scanner app](https://github.com/joaoanes/pokescan), and following the timeline since the game's release, highlighting important moments for Niantic and the reverse engineering community alike.

I've been a software engineer for 2 years now, graduated from FEUP at '14, with a knack and passion for infrastructure, system analysis, automation and quirky retorts. Gamer for years. I love the web stack, and how web standards have elevated the term "web app" to something you don't cringe at over the years. It only gets better from here on out!
