## Introduction

Serverless architectures are becoming fastly adopted by teams allowing "Full 
Stack" developers to become responsible for the daily running of your services
without the need for any Operations / Dev ops; or is this all an illusion?

## Exploration of Techniques.

The audience will explore how we can utilise logging, tracing and other 
techniques to ensure that tracking down issues in your serverless architecture
can be as fast and as painless as with traditional services on servers.

The topics which will be covered are as following

 - Deployment and Configuration
 - API Request Tagging
 - Service Invocation Tracing
 - Service Monitoring
 - Storing and Access Logs

We will explore these techniques and investigate how several frameworks have
managed to overcome the friction of debugging serverless services and how to 
overcome any of the limitations that have arised.

# The Conclusion

The audience will stumble onto the conclusion that logging and monitoring in 
production can be limited based on the providers of the servless architecture
that is used, however it is possible identify these early on and to to innovate.
The audience will also understand that server and serverless solutions must
co-exist to allow teams to innovate and to work with legacy.
