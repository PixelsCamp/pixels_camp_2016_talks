`libp2p` is a new networking suite that avoids reinventing the wheel by leveraging the current network protocols, adapting itself to different scenarios and picking the best route between any two peers. It handles dialing and listening, peer discovery, peer routing, record system, NAT traversal, relaying protocol multiplexing and stream multiplexing.

`libp2p` is the networking stack of IPFS, the InterPlanetary FileSystem.

This talk will go over the architecture of libp2p, the challenges of p2p applications and how we built a networking stack that enables IPFS to be runtime **independent and future proof**.
