Description
-----------

Introduced in 1987 by Ralph C. Merkle, the Merkle Tree is a data structure used for efficiently summarizing and verifying the integrity of large sets of data. Due to its unique content validating and performance qualities, they are especially useful in distributed, peer-to-peer systems where the same data should exist in multiple places. Let's learn how to detect inconsistencies between trees and reduce the amount of transferred data enabling peer-to-peer file sharing by building our own tree with Elixir.
