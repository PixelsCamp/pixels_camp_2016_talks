Description
-----------

I will share my experience about developing firmware for chinese ebikes displays and motor controllers. While I do the same as my day job working for a german company, over the years, I started OpenSource projects to develop knowledge and firmware for chinese ebike motor controllers and displays.

I will share the tricks I did learn, like: how to put working the dirty cheap and resources limited hardware/firmware; why and how OEMs are loocking the final users; how I manage this OpenSource projects.

Extra Information
-----------------

I will mainly focus my presentation on my last year project (https://github.com/OpenSource-EBike-firmware/TSDZ2_wiki/wiki), were I developed knowledge and firmware for a popular and cheap ebike motor. I also developed the firmware for a segments LCD and for another 320x480 color LCD (both of them work with motor). This projects are mostly ended and here is feedback from users:

* this motor now feels more like the Bosch motor
* the motor is more efficient, stronger, it's feel like I have a new motor
* the info which is shown on LCD makes the total package way better
* this is GOLD. I still have a smile on my face
