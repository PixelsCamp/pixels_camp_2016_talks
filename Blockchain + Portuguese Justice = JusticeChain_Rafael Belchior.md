Description

I would like to talk about how 1) Blockchains and 2) how can we reduce corruption in governments using distributed ledger technologies, in particular blockchain.
JusticeChain comes from a need of the Portuguese government to assure compliance from different parties, towards securing an important part of information system: applicational logs.

The talk includes:
1. The social (and technological) aspects of the corruption problem
1. What is blockchain and why do we need it at governments (and also the problems of blockchains)
1. Introducing one of the most popular permissioned blockhains: Hyperledger Fabric
