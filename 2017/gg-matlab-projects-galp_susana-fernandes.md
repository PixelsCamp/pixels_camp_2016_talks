* Speaker   : [Susana Fernandes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/susana-fernandes-39658a87/)
* Length: 45min
* Language: English

Description
-----------

Software’s developed for Oil and Gas industry, specially in the areas of Geosciences, are very complete. Although, the need to generate our own software is present for reasons such as:

* Costs reduction since software packages are very expensive
* Fulfill the needs and strategy of the Company
* Create user-oriented tools
* Generate our own software increases synergies between Geosciences professionals.

Geosolutions team started using Matlab software to develop some requested standalones. These cover a broad spectrum of topics, spanning from geology, geophysics, petrophysics and geochemistry. 

Due to the large amount of data that E&P departments regularly use and also the annual cost and portability problems of Matlab, we are considering to migrate to Python.
