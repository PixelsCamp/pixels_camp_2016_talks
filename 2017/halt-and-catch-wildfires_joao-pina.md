Description
-----------

Working for the third consecutive summer what started as a tool for some friends in a hidden subdomain, today Fogos.pt have around 80k registered users and more than 800k unique visitors in all platforms.
Don't expect to ear about rocket science, this is a talk about how Fogos.pt is made technically, and some of you will probably throw some tomatoes at me :) 

This is the story of the errors, the problems and the solutions behind Fogos.pt!
