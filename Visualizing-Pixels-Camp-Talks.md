Description
-----------

We have an exciting dataset here, the description of the accepted talks of the Pixels Camp from this and previous years. What information can we extract from this? I will get some insights and present them in an interactive and interesting way that can pave the way for more sophisticated questions. Can we extrapolate these results to describe evolution of trends and interests in the Portuguese tech scene?
