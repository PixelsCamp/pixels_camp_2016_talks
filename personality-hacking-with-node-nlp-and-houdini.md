Personality Hacking with Node, NLP and Houdini
=================================================

* Speaker   : Anton McConville
* Available : Any day
* Length    : 60 minutes
* Language  : English

Description
-----------

In this session we use JavaScript on the server, and in the browser to beautifully visualize personality changes of musical artists during their career, through their lyrics.

On the server we use Node to interface with Natural Language Processing APIs. On the client we use WebAudio to explore the dimensions of sound, and experiment with emerging CSS Houdini APIs to play with visualizations.

The session steps through the open source project code, analyzes the outcomes, and considers real world applications for the concepts. We'll dig deeper into CSS Houdini ... taking more time to walk through the creation of a new custom CSS class as a demo.

Extra Information
-----------------

My session is based on a continuing interest that I have in using Natural Language Processing technology for analyzing the changes of personality/psychology of an artist's music over time.

I like to draw simple storybook images of the artists to create a website to accompany the psychology data that NLP reveals. I first talked about it at GitHub CodeConf in 2016 ... you can see that talk here ...

and an example of my work here:

My interest evolved with Houdini CSS to see how that technology might enhance some of the ideas, and I presented my first session looking at Coldplay's lyrics with NLP and Houdini CSS at JSConf Colombia late in 2019 ...

They haven't posted the videos from that conference yet.

I'm currently working on a new analysis of the Beatles lyrics with NLP and exploring more with Houdini.

My session shows how to build with Houdini and looks at the power of NLP using IBM Watson APIs ( which can be used for free in limited ways ). My session also considers web and data literacy as a medium for self expression and understanding. It is a thought provoking and relatable session.
