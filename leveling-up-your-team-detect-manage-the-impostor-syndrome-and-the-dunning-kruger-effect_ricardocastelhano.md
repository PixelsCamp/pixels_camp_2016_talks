Description
-----------

Every software engineer lives between the range of Dunning-Kruger effect and Impostor Syndrome. Know what to look for and how to help your people to overcome it is key to leveling up your engineering team. I will illustrate this reality with my own personal story growing as a software engineer and a human.


Speaker Bio
-----------

I consider myself a creative and curious mind. I made my journey from Mathematics into Creative Computing, then into Web Development and lately to Management. I consider myself a people person, a good communicator, and a good listener. I prefer to play as a team, with a special taste for motivating and helping those around me to achieve better results.
