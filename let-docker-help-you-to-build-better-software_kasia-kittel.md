Description

Docker is mostly known as tool that automates deployment of microservices and continuous delivery. Through very well known and appreciated by devops it's usually excluded from development process.

However inviting Docker to the development may bring a lot of advantages.

In this talk I am going to show how using Docker may improve quality of delivered software especially by helping create reliable integration tests, so important for microservices.
