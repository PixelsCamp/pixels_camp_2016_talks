Description
-----------

These are the million dollar questions when designing distributed systems: Where do we store and replicate data? How to access and change the data? How to recover if a disaster happens? Properly answering these questions will make sure our APIs are healthy and ready to serve an ever-growing client base and an even bigger set of data.
This talk will focus on how we, at Sky, are future-proofing our content discovery APIs to serve channel and scheduling information to all of our European and North American customers. To achieve this, we are using Hazelcast, a scalable in-memory data grid solution on the JVM that eases out the creation of distributed data clusters.

Speaker Bio
-----------

Backend developer, 8 years of experience, and a taste for open source and Java with the ambition of becoming a software architect. I worked on several projects in the context of Telco provisioning environments and also on integration platforms. Along the way, I went from being a graduate with the ambition to change mobile development to the creation of my own start-up.
More recently, I also worked as solution architect and senior technical engineer, on Voxbone’s development team. Covering work on the architecture revamp, software development guidelines, testing procedures and continuous integration.
I don’t like to give up on software. I like to go there and make it work even when it doesn’t seem to do so at first. I also know that there is a difference between coding and developing software. Since I prefer to do the latter, I am certain that one of the most important things for a team is to maintain a healthy code base which is only achieved when there is a focus on, not only, quality but also code maintainability and that is where I want to be.
I like to make a difference, that’s why I do my best everyday.
