Description
-----------

Wouldn't it be cool if you could use natural language to ask questions about your data and get visualisations, built on-the-fly, in response? What if you could have a conversation with the tool to resolve ambiguities and improve the quality of the results. What if it was created using technologies that were either open source or free to use, or could be put into a smart device like the Amazon Echo or even a magic mirror.  Well, you can and, for the most part, thanks to the wonder of JavaScript!

Extra Information
-----------------

In this talk, I focus on how the challenges with NLP can be simplified if you focus on specific problems or data sets. There are no 3rd party NLP libraries being used, just a series of logical steps to determine the users intent. To date, the solution has been deployed on the web (https://twitter.com/websy85/status/745992316394016768), via an Alexa skill (https://twitter.com/WebsyIO/status/946788758904561665) and in a magic mirror (https://twitter.com/websy85/status/986678887332622336).
