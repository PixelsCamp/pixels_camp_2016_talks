Description
-----------

Have you heard about Elixir? What makes it interesting? Why should I care?

We will cover what makes Elixir so special and how you can leverage that potential with the next unicorn in Lisbon - Image to Emojis as a Service! I will guide you through a code example and we will talk about supervision trees, interoperability with other languages and concurrency/parallelism in the Elixir world.

After this, I hope you'll have a clearer view if Elixir is a good fit for your next project.
