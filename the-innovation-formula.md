Description
-----------

Software Development is not only about coding anymore. In fact, it never was. Software Development is about people 
solving problems for other people, with code. 

Innovation is not only about technology anymore. In fact, it never was. Innovation comes from people applying the 
right technology, old or new, to the right problem, at the right time, to the right people.

In this talk, we will try to unveil one of the many formulas for innovation, a human (people) centered one. 

Speaker Bio
-----------

Surfer by passion and Software Architecture by professional experience. After 12 years at the IT world I pretty much felt like a 
machine, so I decided to quit my own company and learn about Psychology and Education with Expressive Arts... wait... what???. 

Currently I'm an Innovation Facilitator at Celfinet, creating the bridge between Software Developers, Telecomm Engeneers and the
Creative Process. I'm also the Co-Founder of the Creativity Gym, a place where anyone can unleash and develop their creative potential.
