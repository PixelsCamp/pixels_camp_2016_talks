Description

In 2018 I participated on my first NanoGenMo which is an event where programmers write code that writes a book during the month of November.

I will talk about how I did my projects, both the good, the bad and the ugly.

I will teach you how to make you own, best practices, how other people did it, and how to prepare yourself for next year's NanoGenMo.
