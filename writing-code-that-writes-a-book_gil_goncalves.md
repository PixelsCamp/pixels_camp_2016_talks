Description
-----------

In 2018 I participated on my first [NanoGenMo](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2018) which is an event where programmers write
code that writes a book during the month of November.

This talk will be all about generative art, more specifically about generating text with code, I will teach you how to make you own,
best practices, how other people did it, and how to prepare yourself for next year's NanoGenMo.

There will be live coding where I will build a book with 50,000 words on stage.

I will be using Python for examples, but the talk will be language agnostic.
