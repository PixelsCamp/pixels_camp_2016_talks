* Length    : 30 - 45 min

## Description

If you have ever tried to learn how to code, you know how hard it is. If you
succeeded at learning it, by now you should also be aware that it does not stop
there.

This talk will cover my personal experience in learning new things,
consolidating knowledge and giving some of it back to the community through
teaching.

It provides many valuable lessons I have learned through years of making a
concerted effort learn new subjects, from programming languages, to business
practices you can apply at your own companies, to create a more welcoming
environment for learners.

Key points:

* Learning how to learn
* Taking the time to learn
* Improving your personal productivity by being more organized
* How, where and at what point in your career can you help the community by
  teaching
