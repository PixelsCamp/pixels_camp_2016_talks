I'm an old-man-from-restelo, who started doing websites in the '90s and currently does, but hates, modern front-end development. I'm the "vanilla forever" guy...

I currently work at Bright Pixel and I'm the main developer of Pixels Camp's website.

I previously worked at SAPO and was the sole front-end developer for the previous 2 versions of the portal's homepage, the highest traffic portuguese website.

I have a passion for standards, minimalist code and optimization (meaning I've got OCD). I'm also a f\*cking weeaboo who loves Sailor Moon, and takes japanese classes.
