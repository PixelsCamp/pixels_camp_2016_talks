I will present a video processing pipeline that is able to mark content boundaries in live tv streams. It means that it is able to distinguish between content and advertising, and able to realign EPG to some extent.
The technologies involved are docker, kafka, python, ffmpeg, a tiny bit of openCV and a lot of Math.
