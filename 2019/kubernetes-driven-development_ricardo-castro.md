=========================

* Speaker   : [Ricardo Castro](https://pixels.camp/mccricardo)
* Length    : 45min + QA
* Language  : English

Description
-----------

Kubernetes is becoming the standard in container orchestration but tooling is still lagging behind more mature environments. While thatâ€™s true, the community has rallied behind this technology and has started to develop tools to help develop, manage and deploy Kubernetes ready applications. This talk aims to introduce tools like Telepresence to improve development by allowing easy interfacing with Kubernetes deployed services, Skaffold to automate builds and deploys and Helm to manage deploys. This talk will also live demo the development of an application and demonstrate all those tools at work.
