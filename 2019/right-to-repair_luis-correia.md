* Language  : English (probably)

Description
-----------

Ever had a device fail on you? Like, a tablet, smartphone, dishwasher, hair dryer, you name it!

The thing is, it is most likely you just threw it away, thinking it was beyond repair.

Phear not, in most cases, it *is* repairable (with notable exceptions) and you can give it an extra life.

Unfortunately, most gadget makers don't want you to repair but rather buy a new one. And they even lock the device down so hard you basicly can't do much with it.

Come hear me talk about it to know more

Main topics will be (in no particular order)

* Planned obsolescence
* Choosing a vendor
* You don't own it unless you can repair it
* Legislation
* Learning how to try and fix things
* The tractor problem
