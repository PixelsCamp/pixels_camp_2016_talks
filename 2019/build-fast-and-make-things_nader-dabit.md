Description
-----------

Building a modern production-ready application entails many crucial yet sophisticated requirements including but not limited to authentication, analytics, an API layer, storage, caching, & offline functionality. In the current economy it is also becoming more expensive & much harder to put together teams that have the expertise needed to build full stack & across multiple platforms, raising the barrier of entry for companies & startups looking to build applications critical to their business.

In this talk, Iâ€™ll introduce a stack using React, React Native, & AWS Amplify, a CLI & client library that allows developers to quickly scaffold cloud enabled services like user-signin, a GraphQL API, Lambda functions, analytics, & even AR & VR services and hook them into their application using the AWS Amplify JavaScript SDK.

AWS Amplify enables traditionally front-end developers to leverage their existing skillset to move further up the stack, allowing them to build full stack we & mobile applications by leveraging a large ecosystem of managed & serverless features & services.
By the end of the talk, developers should understand how to leverage their existing skillset to increase their capabilities in building web & mobile applications.
