Description
-----------

After a long time sitting in the "Peak of Inflated Expectations" and "death by a thousand prototypes" the Internet of Things (IoT) is finally delivering strong, mass-market, solutions. 
This year is already proving to be game changing with key players like Alibaba setting targets of 1 Billion connected devices.

In this talk we explore the motivations driving the IoT, the current directions and take a twist into what can we learn from biology to inform its future path.
 
We'll then look at practical use cases where the IoT - through a combination of accessible connectivity, low power devices and System Flexibility - presents new opportunities and insights from everyday things.
