Description
-----------
One small script from a programmer can be a giant experiment for a biologist. In this talk, I'll try to convince you how bioinformatics, from the mostly theoretical mathematical models to the all-in-one software packages solutions, is the future.

Join me in this journey to expand the intersection between these fields and, who knows, maybe one day a programmer might be able to add “cure cancer” to their CV.

After a Biomedical Engineering degree, with a specialisation in Bioinformatics and Clinical Informatics, I've continued my journey on the line between biology and computer science by pursuing a PhD in Computational Biology, hosted in a fully biological group. This allowed me to have an insight on the matter and on how life in Biology could be made much easier if each group collaborated with computer scientists and programmers.

Extra Information
-----------------

I've given several talks where I present my software to different types of audiences, from biologists to physicists and microscopists. I've found that everywhere I go, I'm asked whether there's more people like me, willing to go to a group and work with them. This is where I got the idea for this talk: talk to an audience that can actually help create the programmers army to tackle problems in other fields.
