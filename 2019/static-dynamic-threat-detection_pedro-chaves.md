Be on top of your game - Static and dynamic analysis of events for threat detection

In 2017, an average of 200,000 new malware samples have been captured, each day. Cybercriminals have stepped up their game and are using advanced techniques to penetrate organization defenses. Therefore, cyber defense departments have to reinvent their defense mechanisms to keep up with the new threats. This evolving landscape of threats demands innovation.

On this talk we plan to present a data analytics platform for threat detection. We will discuss some of the underlying challenges, the key components and techniques that we used. These include a fully featured correlation engine built using Flink, Kafka and Redis, and the employment of machine learning to detect sophisticated threats.
