Description
-----------

In this talk I'm going to talk about strategies to render thousands of linked data points in a HTML canvas smoothly. 
This talk will be based on a graph data use case, but most of the strategies could be applied to other scenarios. 
I will talk using efficient data structures, avoiding computations, avoiding creating garbage and efficient canvas rendering.

I've been a Frontend Engineer at Feedzai for 7 years. I've been on the company almost from it's beginning and I had a big role on
what is the Frontend at Feedzai today (for good and bad). Some of the things I've been involved with: maintaining a 
large SPA, recruiting, architecture decisions and several initiatives inside and outside the company. 
In my free time I'm an amateur photographer.
