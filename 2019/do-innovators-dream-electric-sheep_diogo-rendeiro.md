What are innovative product in tech? How are they built?

20 years ago the dot.com crash pushed Tech to focus, time-to-market, fast iterative cycles and and early validation. Tech innovation became mostly incremental: 10% cheaper, 10% faster, 10% better.

10% better is great, but not enough to compete as a new entrant: to truly capture attention and disrupt market share of incumbent players, innovative tech products must deliver benefits an order of magnitude larger.

How can a company pursue a 10x strategy? How are innovative experiences discovered?

At Feedzai we’ve groomed a toolbox of innovation-focused methods and best practices from an array of disciplines such as: market and competitive intelligence, scientific research, design sprints, and customer development programs.

In this talk, I’ll share the story of 3 AI powered product innovations we’ve pursued in the past year and detail how we have leveraged different innovation tools to test ideas, discover 10x experiences, and validate and go-to-market.
