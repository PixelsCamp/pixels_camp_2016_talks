Description
-----------

Writing tests can be tricky. How do you ensure appropriate coverage yet keep things straightforward
and maintainable? Generative testing exists to reinforce your tests with hundreds of randomised checks,
but it requires changing your test design mentality. This talk introduces fast-check and its underpinnings,
and will help you think less about expected results and more about general behaviour that you can test.
