Going Arabic
=========================

* Speaker   : [Gil Faria](https://pixels.camp/gilfaria)
* Length    : 60 minutes
* Language  : English

Description
-----------

When we talk about internationalization and localization of web applications we consider these, business as usual – there is nothing new.

But what is it like to support the Arabic language in our applications?
Is it enough to translate, change the font, change the direction of the text and the images?

We need to change the User Interface, the code, some processes, and even some tools. We will also need to change our way of thinking and the way we look at our apps.

In this session, we will see some of the problems that arise, a few details that we think make no difference (but do!) and some recommendations to prepare your application for the Arabic language and culture.
