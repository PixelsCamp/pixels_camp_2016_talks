Description
-----------

This talk is what happens when you decide to ~~waste~~ invest 2 years of your life coding a painting web application full-time.

I will be sharing the story of the inner workings of a very strange painting web application.

We are going to delve into the world of computer graphics for the web with a strong focus on WebGL. Don't expect crazy graphics as this is mostly a technical talk. After this talk I hope that you can:

- Know when to use SVG and use its full power
- Know when to use Canvas and use its full power
- Know when to use WebGL and love it
- Know how to avoid some common pitfalls of web CG
- Know some high-performance JS/TS tricks
- Know a bit more about the difficulties of building a product on your own budget and how not to bootstrap your ideas

JavaScript has been a part of my daily life for a few years now. It shares a well respected place along with many other daily activities such as, taking out the trash, morning diarrhea and overall existential dread.
