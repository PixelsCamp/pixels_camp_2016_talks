=========================

* Speaker : [Jo達o Pedro Dias](https://pixels.camp/jpdias)
* Available : Any
* Length : 60min (Workshop)
* Language : English

Description
-----------

*Web of Things* aims to build the Internet-of-Things in a truly open, flexible, and scalable way, using the Web as its application layer.

This talk will focus Web of Things and the role of Mozilla **Project Things** in this context, diving into the particularities of making a *thing* follow web standards in a *machine-readable format with a default JSON encoding*. 

Following the Web of Things road, we are gonna go from understanding the Mozilla Things Framework as far as making a functional *thing* compatible with the Things Gateway, using as an example an Arduino-based indoor sensing hub (based on NodeMCU).
