Taking control of your Identity
=========================

* Speaker   : [João Santos](https://pixels.camp/joaosantos15)
* Length    : 45 min
* Language  : English

Description
-----------

One has very little control over the information about one’s Identity. The state owns your passport, id, driver’s licence. Hospitals and doctors own your medical records. Universities own your academic credentials and have are contacted every time a credential needs verification. The common thread on these examples is that they all rely on a centralized, trusted 3rd party. If said party ceases to exist, so does a portion of your identity.

This talk will focus on the community driven push for Self-Sovereign Identity systems. We will discover how communities such as Rebooting the Web of Trust, Blockcerts and W3C are working on the standards that will shape the future of identity. Standards such as  Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials coupled with decentralized technologies, such as blockchain and IPFS, will empower individuals to take control of their identity and reduce dependency on centralized parties.

My name is João Santos and I am a full stack developer. I got my MSc in Computer Science at Instituto Superior Técnico, my thesis was DClaims, a decentralized censorship resistant framework for web annotations, built on top of Ethereum and IPFS. I joined Consensys in mid-2018 where I worked on an advisory research spoke called Helena, where I mostly developed Solidity smart-contracts. Later, I joined Shipl, where I focus mostly on the backend. Currently, I am collaborating with Moxy and IPFS teams developing the Identity Manager RFC (https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/peer-star/blob/16d50bf50e7bd1ce89f0fe0195e2b522a703766f/docs/rfc-identity.md) and with the Rebooting the Web of Trust community (https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo).
