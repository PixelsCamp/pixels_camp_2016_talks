10+ years of working in Venture Capital in Brazil, recently moved to Lisbon and joined the amazing Beta-i team. In love with startups, learning, iterations, constant improvement & growth and cooking. I believe JFK best summarized it all:

“We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but
because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win …” (JFK, 1962)
