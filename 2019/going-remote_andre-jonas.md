Description

Remote Work. Is it all cookies and rainbows as all those articles in the Internet talk about? Does it mean I can stay in my jammies all day or work through the night? Successfully managing your remote software development career is the embodiment of work-life balance. It comes with a very specific set of difficulties but can also be achieved through a very simple set of principles that I'm going to present in this talk.
