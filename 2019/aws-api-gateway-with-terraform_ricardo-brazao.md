I work as a software developer @Onfido, working mainly in Ruby (being it with Rails, Sinatra or Grape) but currently also looking a bit into the realm of Elixir. Although I'm mostly a backend developer, from time to time I like the frustration of stepping out of my confort zone and dwelve in the front end world or a bit of DevOps stuff as I think a software developer should know a bit of the surrounding universes.

Extra Information
-----------------

This talk will be a presentation version of a blog post that [I wrote a while back](https://medium.com/onfido-tech/aws-api-gateway-with-terraform-7a2bebe8b68f). As this blog post was well received by the community and teached me the basics of Terraform and AWS API Gateway, I wanted to share my learning with the community as well.
