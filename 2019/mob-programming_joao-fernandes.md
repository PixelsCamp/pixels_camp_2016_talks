Mob programming to deliver better software
=========================

* Speaker   : [João Fernandes](https://pixels.camp/JSFernandes)
* Length    : 40 minutes + Q&A
* Language  : English

Description
-----------

Every developer nowadays should have the terms pair programming and code review in their dictionary, and use these techniques on a regular basis. Mob programming improves the efficiency of the latter by putting more people doing the first. While it may be counterintuitive, and managers can and will hate it, it provides some very tangible benefits in terms of product and code quality.

My team has done Mob Programming at Xing, in groups of 4 and 5. We sucked at it, and we gradually became better. In this talk, I will describe this experience and what we learned about the pitfalls, pros, cons, and misconceptions about mob programming.

I am a Software Engineer working at Xing, where I have been doing full stack development with Ruby on Rails and React for 1 year. Before Xing, I worked at Seedrs and Movingworlds.

My team has been doing mob programming since March of this year while implementing GDPR compliance, and we now do it from time to time, usually when laying groundwork for future feature development.

Extra Information
-----------------

In my general experience, I have observed that reasons for tech debt and solutions of poor quality are 33% technical skill, 33% process, and 33% company culture. The remaining 1% is a bit of bad luck. As developers, we are quick to criticize and improve the technical skill while neglecting the other components. While it isn't a silver bullet, mob programming allows for interconnected improvements in skill, process and culture.
