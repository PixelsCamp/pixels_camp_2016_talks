I'm a UI/UX designer turned game developer. After working for 6 years as a designer and front-end developer in digital agencies I jumped into indie gamedev, co-founded Fun Punch Games with a long time friend and started working full time on Strikers Edge as an artist, animator and designer, traveling across multiple countries while promoting the game and winning multiple awards. After Strikers Edge's launch, I continue to expand my knowledge and portfolio with more games and projects at Fun Punch Games.
