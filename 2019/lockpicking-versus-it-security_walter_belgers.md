* Length    : 45 mins
* Language  : English

Description
-----------

In this lecture, Walter Belgers will look at some security flaws in locks to see how they came about. Then, he shows us how similar mistakes are made in software development and deployment. In both cases, we have to deal with design flaws, implementation errors, zero day attacks, brute force attacks, user errors and more. Real life examples will be given and demonstrated. There are some interesting differences in how security is looked at in the hardware and the software world. Both groups can certainly learn each other.
