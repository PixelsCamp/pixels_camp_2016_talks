* Speaker   : [Bernardo Vieira](https://pixels.camp/obernardovieira)
* Length    : Workshop - 50 min
* Language  : English or Portuguese

Description
-----------

Yeah yeah, you heard about it, blockchain. But we are in 2019 and blockchain is 'still' around (some thought it would disappear).

With [ethereum blockchain](https://www.ethereum.org/) and the help of the [truffle framework](https://truffleframework.com/) we will build a decentralized application.

We will use [solidity language](solidity.readthedocs.io) and [nodejs](nodejs.org) (javascript) although it does not require any previous knowledge. Please join, bring questions, a laptop or at least attention.

Hi, my name is Bernardo, I'm currently in Lisbon working for a blockchain company. I work mostly with ethereum blockchain and the tools around it, but I've also worked with hyperledger fabric and stellar.

I'm very passionate about this field and what it can bring to us. Reach me during the event, it will be a pleasure to meet you.
