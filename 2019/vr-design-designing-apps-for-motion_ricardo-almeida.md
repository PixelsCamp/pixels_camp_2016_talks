Description
-----------

In this presentation we will be discussing what changes when we need to consider user body and space rather than computer periferals during VR development.

How do you plan for motion, how do you start thinking about motion? What problems can there be? 

Developing VR can be tricky but after this talk hopefully you will learn from my mistakes so you avoid yours.

Hello there! So for a brief introduction, I work at Collide as a Game Designer and Software Engineer!

VR is our main area and we are proud to have worked on several challenging projects some of which you may have heard!

I'm really passionate about Videogames, to me they are an art form like no other. 

I've worked on several team projects, some of which are, an educational game for the hearing impaired, with the aim of teaching sign language, this was done with the support from Associação Portuguesa de Surdos, from which we published a Scientific Paper, VR4NeuroPain which you can check out at our Website www.Collide.rocks, our very own Project Chatrooms and several others!

Right now I aim to become one of the, if not the, best Game Designers in the world.

I've still got a ways to go but I'm working on getting there!

If you've read this far, well thank you and have an awesome day!
