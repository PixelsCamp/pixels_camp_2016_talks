Description
-----------

State Management libraries are like rabbits these days, there is one for every taste. But state management it's not a really hard problem to solve, so, why there are so many solutions for such easy problem.

This talk it's not only about a real world application that is mainly React, but it's also about a real world application that is entirely written in javascript, with pure functional code and no state management frameworks.

In this application we leverage the use of Observables (RxJS) and it's operators to support our functional code, and we end up using Observables as well for state management.

Although, there were some caveats when passing Observables to our React components, reason being that, Observable objects don't change, therefore our components don't refresh/redraw as expected.

This talk is about explaining this approach, it's architecture, how we tackled the issues with Observables and React components update, and ultimately showing that this can be a viable solution, currently used in production in one of our clients.

João is a Software Engineer with 10+ years of experience working on the field. He has always worked very closely with clients, doing analysis and requirements elicitation, and over time he has gained an inept skill to solve business needs using software.

Since the beginning of his career João has specialised mainly on server side solutions, but his curiosity and eagerness to learn, quickly pushed him to explore all the angles of an application. This has enabled him to be as proficient on the frontend, as he is on the backend. He is also experienced on DevOps work using technologies such as Kubernetes, Docker, Shell Script and Jenkins Pipelines.

He holds a MSc in Computer Science Engineering with a Major in Embedded Systems from the University of Lisbon.
