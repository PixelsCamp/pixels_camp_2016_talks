Pixels vs. Juice Shop
=====================

* Speaker : [Bjoern Kimminich](https://pixels.camp/bkimminich)
* Length : Workshop (3h)
* Language : English

Description
-----------

In this workshop you can test your skills in hacking modern web applications against the [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp-juice.shop)! There are 80+ hacking challenges that are waiting to be solved, ranging from simple functional problems and the usual XSS/SQLi issues over severe authentication flaws up to multi-step and multi-path attacks!

The workshop will consist of multiple short teasers to specific vulnerabilities and lots of time for hacking! You can then stick to the teasered topic or go into free-roaming mode and just try to beat as many challenges as possible. Your pace is entirely up to you! Some of the more mindboggling challenges can optionally be tackled in a "swarm-hacking" style together on the big screen. Over the entire duration of the training you can get first-hand hints by the creator of the Juice Shop in case you get stuck on any challenge.
