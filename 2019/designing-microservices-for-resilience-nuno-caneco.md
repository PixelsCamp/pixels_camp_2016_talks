Designing Microservices for Resilience
=========================

* Speaker   : [Nuno Caneco](https://pixels.camp/nmcc)
* Length    : 60 minutes
* Language  : English

Description
-----------

With the rise and wide-spread use of microservices architecture, a set of new challenges related to availability arise.

Where once - in a monolith - there was a local call within the application stack, now - in a distributed architecture - there's a request to an application that lives elsewhere. And with that, a lot of things can (and will) go wrong.

Put this on an environment that requires high availability or is subject to high load and things will get nasty.

In this talk, we'll see some of the consequences of not dealing with errors properly and learn how to use techniques like Timeouts, Circuit Breakers and Fallbacks to overcome some of these challenges and get back in control.

Extra Information
-----------------

In this talk, I will demonstrate how to use Circuit Breakers, Timeouts and Fallback to improve an application resilience.

I will also use load test tools (live) to prove the positive impact these techniques have on error rates and performance.
