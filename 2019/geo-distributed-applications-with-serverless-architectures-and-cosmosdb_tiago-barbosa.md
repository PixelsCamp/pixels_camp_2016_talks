Geo-distributed applications with Serverless Architectures and CosmosDB
=========================

* Speaker   : [Tiago Barbosa](https://pixels.camp/t1agob)
* Length    : 60 minutes
* Language  : English or Portuguese

Description
-----------

Working as an Azure Engineer with customers all around the world I still see customers (startups and ISVs) having huge challenges when designing their solutions in terms of scalability and geo-distribution.

This is not an architecture session. This session is about showing you patterns that work and how easy it is to implement them. Few slides and more hands-on will be the objective of this session where we will use mainly CosmosDB as a datastore and Azure Functions as a serverless backend for our geo-distributed application. Still, the same patterns can be used in other cloud platforms.

Tiago is an Engineer working for the Azure Product Team at Microsoft. Tiago has been working for Microsoft for the last 9 years and he has always focused on Application Development.

If you don't find him working with some customer to move their workloads to Azure you will probably find him trying to surf some waves around in Lisbon.
