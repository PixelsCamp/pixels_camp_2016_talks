Description
-----------

Should I use protective gear when Extreme Programming?
Do developers that enjoy pair programming end up marrying each other?
Does trunk based development imply using an axe?

We'll answer these and many other questions by (scuba) diving into extreme programming methodology.
We hope to debunk the myths of the XP buzzword bingo, by uncovering the secrets of TDD, CI, CD, Trunk Dev., Lean and Balanced Teams.

...and we believe in pairing so much that we'll use it during this presentation.
