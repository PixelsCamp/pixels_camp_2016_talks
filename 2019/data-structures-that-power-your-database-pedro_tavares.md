Description
-----------

On the most fundamental level, a database needs to do two things: when you give it some data, it should store the data, and when you ask it again later, it should give the data back to you. Why should you, as an application developer, care how the database handles storage and retrieval internally? In order to select the storage engine that is appropriate for your application, you need to have a rough idea of what the storage engine is doing under the hood. In this talk, weâ€™ll discuss and examine some core data structures such as Hash Indexes, SSTables, LSM-Trees, and B-Trees, that are used in the traditional relational databases and NoSQL databases.
