AR could be the future. Do you know how it works and what you can build with it?

There are many AR techonolgies being showcased every year by top tier companies e.g. Google, Microsoft, and Apple. Apple showcased during their WWDC 2018 event their latest AR endeavor: ARKit 2.

Apple showcased many projects they are working on during their [WWDC 2018 event](https://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2018/), how far theyâ€™ve come, and how there is still so much to improve upon. Among their many keynotes, one of them touched on their latest AR endeavor: ARKit 2. This piqued my interest in the subject and, since I had some free time on my hands and wanted a new pet project, wellâ€¦ here we are ðŸ˜…

This talk will not teach you the basics of ARKit, it will take you on a journey through the process of discovering a very promising piece of technology and creating a "useful" AR experience.

For most people AR is magic: they don't know how it works or what can be done with it. This talk aims to demystify some concepts, teach a bit of the basics, and inspire people to create more AR content.

Full disclosure, this talk will not be about teaching you the basics of ARKit, there are already plenty of good tutorials out there ([hereâ€™s a really cool one!](https://blog.markdaws.net/apple-arkit-by-example-ef1c8578fb59)) and I donâ€™t want to just be another one of those. I want to take you on a journey through the process of discovering a very promising up-and-coming piece of technology and creating an "actually useful" AR experience, and not just some technological showcase of loosely coupled standalone features and gimmicks.

There'll probably be some code snippets, but that shouldn't be the focus.

Maybe you haven't heard of me, but I am [Time Magazine's 2006 person of the year](https://www.adherecreative.com/hs-fs/hubfs/time-you.jpg?width=570&height=760&name=time-you.jpg). It's a lot of responsibility, but such is a (Rockstar|Unicorn|Code Ninja)'s life.

**About what I do:**
I'm an avid supporter of the open source community, meaning that I often use open source content in my projects and, in return do them the courtesy of not introducing bugs of my own. I'm a full-stack cross-platform developer, meaning that I can add ~~bugs~~ features just about anywhere in your codebase without much sweat. I've ~~crashed~~ built and ~~obfuscated~~ maintained Android, iOS, and Rails web apps over the course of roughly 5 years of ~~paid~~ professional endeavors and my motto is `Quidquid latine dictum sit, altum videtur`.
