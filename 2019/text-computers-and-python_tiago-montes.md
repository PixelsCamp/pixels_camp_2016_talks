Text, Computers and Python
==========================

* Speaker   : [Tiago Montes](https://pixels.camp/tmontes)
* Length    : 45 minutes + Q&A.
* Language  : English.

Description
-----------

In this talk I go over the fundamentals of the representation and processing of textual information with computers, in general, followed by multiple examples of Python code and techniques, easily transposable to any other techology.

Sharing a valuable historic perspective on the evolution of writing, communication systems and computers, I'll take attendees in a journey of deep understanding why things are the way they are today.

From there, we'll grasp the reality of text encodings leading to the current Unicode standard, along with finer grained details it covers across a wide range of important but often unknown or neglected nuances.

Fundamental concepts such as the distinction between textual information and binary information are introduced and presented with Python code examples and associated techiques.

After this talk attendees will have a very clear picture of how computers represent and process textual information and the role that Unicode plays in that, in a world still full of data stored and distributed in legacy encodings and techologies.

Extra Information
-----------------

I did this talk at the Python LX meetup in Jan 23rd, 2019 where it had a very good reception (according to the organizers).

I'm applying precisely because one of them, Daniel Serrano from Onfido, wholehartedly recommended I did so! :)

The slides I used are currently [published here](https://slides.com/tmontes/text-computers-and-python-v1#/) and will probably suffer from minor revision before the Pixels Camp talk.
