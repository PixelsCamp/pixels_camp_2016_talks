Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Product Managers
============================================================

* Speaker   : [João Craveiro](https://pixels.camp/jpgcc)
* Length    : 60 minutes
* Language  : English

Description
-----------

A Product Manager is someone sitting in the intersection between Business, User Experience and Technology, and has the mission of discovering and delivering a product that is valuable, usable, and feasible. Odds are you work, will work, or have worked with a Product Manager. Though you're on the same boat, the relation between a Product Manager and the development team is not without tension. The Product Manager has the conundrum of having a big responsibility but little-to-no authority, and is prone to get a bad rep with the team for being the messenger of the business needs.

This talk is 100% aimed at people working with a Product Manager. The goal is to shed some light on the nuances and challenges of the Product Manager (including where one usually misbehaves! ;-) ), in a way that (hopefully) allows you to (i) work better with one; and (ii) help one work better with you.

I'm a Product Manager with 4 years of experience in that function, plus previous experience as a software engineer and as a scientific researcher. My professional mission is leading software development teams to deliver customer value effectively and efficiently, and continuous improvement is my central principle.

I'm currently a Product Manager at Onfido, a London-based startup using machine learning to help businesses worldwide verify the identities of their customers online using just a picture of an ID card and a selfie.

Extra Information
-----------------

Among the [talks I previously gave](https://jpgcc.eu/talks/), the most related to the one I'm hereby proposing is "[What the heck is a Product Manager?](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yddHtvWbsGVhFpy2x28o5a0_LsHfczGFnL50HltwaJQ/edit?usp=sharing)" (which I delivered at Pixels.Camp 2.0 --- no recording :-( --- and also at invited lectures to Computer Science & Engineering and Information Technology students at U. Lisbon). For an audience mostly made of *makers*, the value prop of that talk was more around Product Management as a possible future career move. For this edition, the value prop of my talk is to help makers relate better with Product Managers to the benefit of their current roles. To that avail, I'll be levearing both my experience as a Product Manager and my previous experience as a Software Engineer.

The stated length of 60 minutes is inclusive of setup and Q&A.
