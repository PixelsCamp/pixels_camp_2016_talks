Description

For the past years we've been shifting a lot of power from our servers to our browsers. But with great power comes great responsability. Especially when you have to consider some of your users have low bandwith and low CPU power.

As our AngularJS applications started growing, we started feeling the burden of all that code running on older machines. Most of the solutions we adopted are based on delaying all CPU/network effort for as long as we can, with some lazy rendering and lazy loading techniques.

We ended up open sourcing some tools and I hope we can share most of our findings in order to help your Angular apps load as fast as possible!
