Description
-----------

The Node.js culture is very active in creating and publishing modules for almost every imaginable need. On average, a Node.js project has a lot more dependencies than projects with other technologies like .NET or Java. Managing those dependencies can become overwhelming if the project has hard requirements in terms of reliability or legal.

There is to many modules to approve, npm has almost three hundred thousand modules and it's still growing. So it makes total sense to have a tool that gives you an overview of your dependencies and tell what are you exposed to.
