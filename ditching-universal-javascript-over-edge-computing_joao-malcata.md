Description
-----------

Universal JavaScript, also known as Isomorphic JavaScript, has become a best practice, now widely supported on most JavaScript frameworks. Even though we have started by building SPAs with SSR support, we soon evolved into a micro-web apps approach, only to realize that there is a high toll to be paid. As we move our web apps to the edge, I will build a case on why we are willing to ditch SSR.

Keywords: SPA, SSR, Universal JavaScript, Edge Computing
