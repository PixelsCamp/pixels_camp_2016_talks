Description
-----------

Almost all developers just hate the idea of code reviews and I ~~am~~was not an exception!

About 1 year ago I started working for Subtraction, 100% remotely and doing code reviews almost all days.
During this time I've had the opportunity to dismistify my misconceptions and discover the beauty side behind it, with great advantages!
I'll talk about my experience, initial struggles and show how code reviews can be done without great pain, helping you and your team more than you imagine...

Some examples will be shown to try to illustrate and get you to discuss about how code review can be a great frend on improving your code quality, decreasing your bugs and backing every team member on improving his code skills (learn/share knowledge and best practices), ending on shipping better products.
