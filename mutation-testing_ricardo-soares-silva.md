Description
-----------

Every day we write tests to ensure the quality of our code. But what ensures the quality of our tests?
Mutation Testing is a method of inserting faults (mutants) into programs to verify whether the tests pick them up, thereby guaranteeing their quality.

Do you want to improve the quality of your tests?
Do not let mutants invade your code.

Join us to learn how to create and kill some mutants.
