Description
-----------

Our friends, especially non-geeks, in most cases do not want to know about security in the digital age.
If we are going to talk about AES, Linux, data retention laws, VoIP, WebRTC and things like that, they just don't care. 

So it is best to speak things in simple terms and speak "normal Portuguese" with them: we talk about the same products, but with an interesting and different approach.

This talk aims to show some essential tools to your privacy and that of your friends. No complicated facilities. Out-of-the-box.
Maybe you know some products for it's tech specs, but you will learn to talk about this products in a more human way. :)
