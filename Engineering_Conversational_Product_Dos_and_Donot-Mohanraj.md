Description
-----------

Digital Experiences offer a connected world with seamlessly connected experiences across multiple customer touchpoints and channels. Hence, Chatbots and Voicebots cannot live in a vacuum. They need to be connected to all the relevant touchpoints offered in other channels. With a wide variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) choices, conversational channels, and chatbot platforms, creating meaningful experiences in conversational products is not trivial. For example, a product that works with limited channels like Facebook Messenger and Alexa needs to scale better to work with other channels and languages.
 
In this experiential talk, Mohanraj Karatadipalayam gives you a detailed overview of his experiences and learnings during the development of the conversational experience product. He explains the easy and difficult decisions while developing such product for the conversational commerce. He also lists the painful mistakes made, key challenges encountered while writing such apps and how he overcame them.
