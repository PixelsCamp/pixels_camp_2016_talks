Workshop HARDWARE CITY | Making Noise with BITalino
========================

* Speaker   : *Hugo Plácido da Silva*
* Available : *October 6th, ~~14:00-15:30~~ (morning)* 
* Length    : *90 mins*
* Language  : *English or Portuguese (depends on the attendance)*

Description
-----------

BITalino has been extending the principles of physical computing to the domain of body signals, forever changing the way projects and applications involving physiological data are made. In this workshop we’ll dive into the BITalino hardware and software frameworks, in particular:
Anatomy of a BITalino
* How to collect and what to extract from each signal
* Experimental procedures and recommendations (e.g. noise sources, grounding)
* Examples of different biosignal-based applications
* BITalino & Embedded Systems
* Working with the API 
* Important programming considerations
* OpenSignals Rapid Application Development framework

Number of Attendees: 
Up to 15 participants to be organised in groups of 3 for the hands-on component (more participants can attend but not participate in the hands-on)
Means: Bring your own computer
Install OpenSignals: http://bitalino.com/index.php/software

Speaker Bio
-----------

Hugo believes he’s one of the few lucky people that can say he worked very few days in his life... not because of a lack of a job (fortunately), but because when you do stuff you love and you're passionate about almost every single day, there's no boundary between what's work and what's just pure fun.

He received his PhD in Electrical and Computers Engineering from the Univeristy of Lisbon. Since 2004, Hugo has been working as a researcher at the IT - Instituto de Telecomunicações (http://www.it.pt/person_detail_p.asp?id=1293). Hugo is also one of the co-founders of PLUX – Wireless Biosignals (http://www.plux.info), established in 2007 as an innovative technology-based company operating in the field of medical devices for healthcare and quality of life, where he is currently a Board Member and Innovation Advisor.  
 
More recently, he has been actively working (i.e. having fun) towards making the world a bit more physiological, through BITalino (http://www.bitalino.com), an open source software and low-cost hardware toolkit, that allows anyone from students to professional app developers, to create cool projects and applications with physiological sensors.  

His main interest areas include physiological computing (aka biosignals), system engineering, signal processing, and pattern recognition.
