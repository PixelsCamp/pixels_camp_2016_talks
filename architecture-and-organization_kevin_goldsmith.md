Description
-----------

Over 50 years ago, Melvin Conway wrote an article identifying a correspondence between the structure of our organizations and the structure of the software we produce. We still talk about Conway's Law today because of the fundamental truth of that observation. This talk goes beyond that article to examine why this happens, and how you can take advantage of it to make better software and better teams.
