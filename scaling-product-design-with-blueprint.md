Description
-----------

Blueprint (http://blueprintjs.com/) is a collection of open-source React UI components that cover the majority of the common interface elements, patterns, and interactions on the web. At Palantir we use it every day, we like it so much that we want to share how to get started with Blueprint, choices and optimisations, dive into the components, and which best practices to apply in order to have the cleanest dev experience. By the end of the talk, you'll take away how using Blueprint ensures that you’ll end up with an elegant and easy-to-use UI, freeing you to focus on building your product—not the atomic pieces that comprise it.
