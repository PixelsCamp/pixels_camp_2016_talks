Description
-----------

An enterprise mobile application is bespoke to an organization and is expected to be used only by the workers of that organization. This does not include the mobile apps that an organization creates for its customers.
It might seem like it’s just another app but there are significant differences and challenges when it comes to developing and maintaining such apps. In this talk, we explore the main contrasts and describe how at Beboc we have overcome the obstacles and leveraged some of the unique characteristics of enterprise apps.
