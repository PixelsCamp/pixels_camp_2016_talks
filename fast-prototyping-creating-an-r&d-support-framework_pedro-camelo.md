Description
-----------

Do you work in R&D or had possibility to do programming prototypes and ended up doing a full scale system where a simple code was enough as a Proof of Concept ? Do you struggle to maintain a good trade of between research and production code ? Then this talk is for you.

This talk will cover the experience I've gained over my 5 years at Bitsight doing R&D on our Security Research team core systems. From higly sensitive code that may *heavily* impact production to one time run scripts and projects that are useful to understand if an idea is feasible in line with product. 

Speaker Bio
-----------

I am a Security Data Researcher and Architect at BitSight Technologies. Have a MSc in Computer Engineering and have been building systems to better protect those who are infected by malware. Have been a recurrent participant in Pixels Camp and this year I want to give something back to this great conference.

I've presented at Botconf 2014 where [I spoke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpSHHbktoFY) about my thesis results, a machine learning classifier to detect malicious domain names and a graph based approach to detect botnets.
