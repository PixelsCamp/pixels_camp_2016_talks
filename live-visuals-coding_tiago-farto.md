Live Visuals Coding
========================

* Speaker   : *Tiago Farto*
* Available : *as late as possible*
* Length    : *around 30 minutes*
* Language  : *I'm not planning on talking much on this*

Description
-----------

I'm proposing something a little different. Should you choose to accept this mission, I'll be live coding some shader code (GLSL) to the sound of something, [inspired by revision's shader battles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-1zEo7DD8w). I'll be open to suggestions, and I'll try to explain how distance field rendering works in the process.


---------------
*Since this is not really a talk, and I don't want to take anyone's opportunity to speak, I can try doing it outside the main talk slots, something like last edition's "short talks" thing, that was held outside near the food area. If enough of you show any interest. But __don't accept it__ just because, I had __3 persons__ on my talk last year, that's neither good for me or the event itself.
__Kisses__.*

Man enough to try it.
