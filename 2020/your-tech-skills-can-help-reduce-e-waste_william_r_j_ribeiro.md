## Description

In this talk, William tells a story of how after a bad experience with a recent bought TV, he started questioning what was going wrong in the gadget world. The answers revealed the dramatic state of the current e-waste problem that the speaker shares just a glimpse.

Motivated by his discoveries and skills as software developer, he decides to rollup his sleeves and do something about it: a web app for his TV! William shows some code for fast 2D rendering techniques with HTML 5 and JavaScript that he learned and used. His goal is to show that great software performance increases gadget longevity thus reducing e-waste.

## Extra Information

I've done this presentation once for a Landing.jobs Meetup in 2019 and got some really good feedback and response. I would love to share it to a bigger audience because I believe e-waste is a serious problem and that we developers can actually help reduce it by doing our job right.
