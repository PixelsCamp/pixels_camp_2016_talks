# Your tech skills can help reduce e-waste

- Speaker : William R. J. Ribeiro
- Available : first, second and third days
- Length : 60m
- Language : English

## Description

In this talk, William tells a story of how after a bad experience with a recent bought TV, he started questioning what was going wrong in the consumer electronics world. The answers he found, and shares with his audience, reveals the dramatic state of the current e-waste problem and the precarious working conditions of the mining industry.

Motivated by his findings and skillset as a software developer, he decides to roll up his sleeves and do a little experiment: a web app for his TV! With his app, William proves a point that great software performance increases gadget longevity thus reducing e-waste.

The presentation contains some slides for technically discussing fast 2D rendering techniques and some HTML 5 and JavaScript code.

## Extra Information

Hello! I've done this presentation once for a Landing.jobs Meetup in 2019 and got some really good feedback and response from the audience. I would love to share it with a bigger audience because I believe e-waste is a serious problem and that we developers can actually help reduce it by doing our job right. Since Pixels Camp will be full of geeks, I'll adjust my presentation to focus more on the geeky technical parts.
