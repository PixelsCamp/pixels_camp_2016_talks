Description

Richard Gabriel once wrote about the rise of "Worse is Better" in constrast
with the "Right Thing" (aka the MIT approach): both of them strive to
design systems towards Simplicity, Correctness, Consistency and Completenes.

By keeping Simplicity paramount and the economical factors that come out
of it, he argues "Worse is Better" has better survival characteristics.
It was 1991 and his examples were C and UNIX. Erlang was still in the lab
and the BEAM in someone's head, but the "Let it Crash" mantra embraces
the same mentality: simple building blocks not to be mistaken with
incorrect, inconsistent or incomplete systems.

This talk will go over the two types of testing you can and should use
to avoid the pitfalls of letting it crash outside of your control and
how they work through the unknowns of distributed systems to provide a
safety net. How can property-based tests and load-tests help you get
the limits of your systems before your customers do? How to start doing
them gradually and in a practical way? A tale of my experience using these
tools to ensure scalable and reliable systems.
