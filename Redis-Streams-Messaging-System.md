Description
-----------

Redis is an in-memory DB, used in many production environments. Now, with the version 5, it has a new data type available - Streams.

This can be used as a message broker or as a job queue system. It isn't a replacement for mature solutions for these components, but an easy and simple alternative.

This talk will include:
- brief description of Redis
- some relevant data types in Redis (like pub/sub)
- streams data type
- how to use it
- my use case
- some performance considerations 

Speaker Bio
-----------

I have been using the Redis since 2014 in production systems, with functions as an IPC, log aggregator, jobs system, disk I/O cache, etc.
Now, I'm redesigning the back office of a southbound interface (SBI) for network equipment, using Redis Streams. :-)
